# Advances in Database Systems(Spring 2022)
Databases have become so crucial that makes it difficult to think the absence of databases in application developments.
In addition, Database programming has become one of the basic knowledge that program developers should know. 
However, many developers simply understand and use the database as a means of storing data. 
In this lecture, students will acquire knowledge about database design techniques and the internals of the database for effective uses. 
In addition, a big data system for efficiently storing and utilizing a massive volume of data that is difficult to process within a single sited DBMS and how to use it will be studied.
